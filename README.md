# Microchannels experiments: Interactions between bacteria and algae within different mesocosms
These two experiments aim to explore the interactions between bacteria and algae within two different mesocosms. In Experiment 1, published in Aquatic Botany, we manipulated light exposure, the quantity of nutrients, and the interaction with the bromeliad mesocosm holding the community. In Experiment 2, we manipulated light exposure, the quantity of nutrients, and the presence/absence of mosquito larvae.
